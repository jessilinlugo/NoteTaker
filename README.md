After exceeding my previous study record (now 18 hours) reviewing Express I felt tentatively confident in my abilities. I was able to piecemeal together most of the code through class activities and some general guidance from my tutor before starting the assignment. After learning and implementing the module exports so I could separate my functions into different files, I was on my way.

Soon after exporting the modules and their respective libraries, I had to work on setting up the relative pathing and ensure caution to not implement any absolute pathing. Unfortunately, this is where it gets tricky. Every time I think I have a grasp on something simple like ./path notation, something like my notes not posting makes me question everything I've written.

After meeting with my tutor, who introduced me to the router package (which allows for easier exports of the Express package), we decided to comment my delete function out to focus on getting my saved notes showing again. I'm not sure what exactly happened, since I didn't touch the provided code.

I spent nearly an hour and a half with my tutor, and a full hour in office hours with my Instructor and TA just trying to get my pathing and response corrected. Fortunately, we were at least able to resolve the response with the saved notes from the db.json file printing out into the console log. In the screenshots you'll find all the gibberish I typed up each time I tested the note saving function. 

Future implementation for this assignment will definitely include getting the data from the JSON file to print to the screen, but honestly, for now, I just wanted to turn this in and be done with it.
